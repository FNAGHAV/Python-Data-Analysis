# Python Data Analysis

In this repository, you'll find Python scripts for two real-world data analysis tasks: PyBank and PyPoll. These challenges will test your Python scripting skills as you analyze financial records and election data.

PyBank Instructions
For the PyBank challenge, I analyzed the financial records of a company using the provided dataset budget_data.csv. The dataset contains two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". I created a Python script that calculates the following:

Total number of months included in the dataset
Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, along with the average of those changes
Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The final script will print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

PyPoll Instructions
For the PyPoll challenge, I modernized the vote-counting process using the provided dataset election_data.csv. The dataset contains three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". I created a Python script that calculates the following:

Total number of votes cast
Complete list of candidates who received votes
Percentage of votes each candidate won
Total number of votes each candidate won
Winner of the election based on popular vote
Similar to PyBank, the final script will print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

The provided datasets are intentionally large to showcase the limitations of Excel-based analysis. Python scripting provides more powerful options for handling big data, making it a valuable skill for data analysts.
